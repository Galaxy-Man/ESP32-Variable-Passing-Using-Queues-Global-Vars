It's not Rocket Science! 

Here's all you need to know on how Queues work in RTOS and the ESP32 to pass values from one task to another in a safe manner. Just a couple of statements and it's done. 

But this is a **Deep Dive** so we do cover the subject properly. 

As if that is not enough we also cover an alternative way of passing values between tasks - but is it any better? I'll leave that for your to decide.

As an extra (as if this video is not already long enough) we investigate how the Prime Number calculator suddenly increases its processing time from around 60 milliseconds to 1.7 seconds. What is going on?
